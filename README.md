The Project is about adding,removing and showing people coming for bday party. 
it is basic application implemented for practicing some of JS array methods.
I have not focused on styling much, main focus was on JS [which is also basic]
I have learned JS Array method such as :sort,reverse,push,pop,shift,unshift,splice,indexOf and join 
In project i have used : push,splice and indexOf.
